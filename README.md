# stock-price-prediction
This Python script predicts future stock prices using historical data. It utilizes machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to forecast stock prices for a given ticker symbol. The script fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, trains a predictive model, and estimates the stock price for a future date.
